        1\r\nPut a large saucepan of water on to boil.\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\nFinely chop
        the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino
        cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3\r\nBeat the 3
        large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black
        pepper. Set everything aside.\r\n\r\nSTEP 4\r\nAdd 1 tsp salt to the boiling
        water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook
        at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).\r\n\r\nSTEP
        5\r\nSquash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to
        bruise it.\r\n\r\nSTEP 6\r\nWhile the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta
        with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and,
        as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.\r\n\r\nSTEP
        7\r\nLeave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until
        the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour,
        so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.\r\n\r\nSTEP 8\r\nKeep the
        heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the
        water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.
        Don\u2019t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this
        to happen) and don\u2019t throw the pasta water away yet.\r\n\r\nSTEP 9\r\nMix
        most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling
        over later.\r\n\r\nSTEP 10\r\nTake the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the
        heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork,
        lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens
        but doesn\u2019t scramble, and everything is coated.\r\n\r\nSTEP 11\r\nAdd
        extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do
        it). You don\u2019t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if
        needed.\r\n\r\nSTEP 12\r\nUse a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to
        the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the
        remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little
        dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness
        will be revived.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/llcbn01574260722.jpg","strTags":"Pasta,BBQ,Breakfast","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_T6jkRvhlkk","strIngredient1":"Spaghetti","strIngredient2":"Egg
